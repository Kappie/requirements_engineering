## Preparation
We discussed possible ways in which technology can aid the writing process. 
- (paid) forums allow everyone to take writing education.
- simple structuring can be provided by word processor. (for educational
  purposes.)
- we have spellcheckers, but can we have more? (sentence level.)
- creative process cannot be aided.

## Interview 1
Direct questions about technology and the process do not elicit a good
response. Questions like "do you like writing?" or "What kind of assignment
are you working on?" got better responses.

## Interview 2
This was not very productive.

## Interview 3
This was not very productive.

## Interview 4

## Interview 5 (apprenticing)
In this interview, we asked the interviewees to write a recommendation for one of
the courses they had followed this year. We specifically stated that the
audience were fellow students. After three minutes of writing, we talked about
the writing process.

Most important findings:
- it was not very hard to do
- the interviewees were not very content with what they wrote, but when we asked
  them why, they couldnt produce many reasons, and after all, seemed quite
  content. Most agreed that with 5 minutes of editing, the piece would be ready
  for publishing in a faculty paper. It was interesting that before the
  discussion, the interviewees stated that the pieces needed at least an hour of
  editing.
